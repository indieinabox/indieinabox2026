## 🚀 Running the Project

### Installation

Make sure you have PHP (7.4 to 8.4+) and Composer installed:

```bash
composer install
```

### Static Site Generation

To compile the static site from your content files:

```bash
# Execute standard build
php build.php

# Execute development build (with live-reload script injections)
php build.php -d

# Skip copying static assets
php build.php -s

# Force overwrite of static files
php build.php -f
```

The output static files will be compiled and written to the `public/` directory.

### Single-File Application

Indieinabox can be compiled into a single drop-in PHP file for easy deployment:

```bash
# Compile to a single file
php compile.php
```

This will create `indieinabox.php` which embeds all logic, the SQLite database configuration, and an installer.

### Testing and Linting

The repository comes with development QA tools:

```bash
# Run unit tests (Pest PHP)
composer test

# Run code linter and compatibility checks
composer sniffer
```
